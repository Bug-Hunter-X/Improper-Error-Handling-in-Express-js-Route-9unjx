# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions. The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, where a database operation lacks proper error handling. This can lead to application crashes or inconsistent responses to client requests.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring the application responds gracefully to database errors and prevents unexpected failures.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` for the corrected version). 
4. Observe the console output and the application's behavior.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in the `/users/:id` route handler. It fetches a user from a database, but it fails to handle potential errors during the database query. If an error occurs (e.g., the user ID is invalid or the database connection is down), the application will likely crash or send an incomplete response, resulting in a bad user experience.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing comprehensive error handling within the database callback. The improved version checks for errors and, if present, sends an appropriate error response to the client. This approach prevents crashes and provides informative responses to the user, leading to a more robust application.
